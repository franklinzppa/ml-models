This repository contains machine learning (and related) algorithms for data science that I've rewritten for educational purposes.

* At the present moment, I've writted codes for **Decision Trees**, **Linear Regression**, **KMeans** and **KNN**.

* The models are made using **object oriented programing (OOP)**, in a similiar fashion to the `sklearn` modules.

* I'm planning to add **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest** and tools such as **Cross Validation** in the future.
